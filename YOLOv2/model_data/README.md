This is for model data,including three files:
* coco_classes.txt,which is about classes' names
* yolo_anchors.txt,which is about yolo anchor setting
* yolo.h5,I guess you dont want to train YOLO yourself,cause it's too slow,so just download it from  official YOLO website,but here
has been processed into h5,I will upload it to Google Driver,see readme on first page
